A small step into the world of algorithm.


Choose C as main language in practice, following examples set by [hello 算法](https://www.hello-algo.com/chapter_hello_algo/).


What makes this project distinct from the origin codes given by the book mentioned before? Maybe some grammatical or lexical adjustments made by myself or others, maybe more detailed annotations, maybe the truth that I do write all of these stuff with my fingers.
